## Notes
1. `FramelessWindow` provides a custom title bar. If you don't like it, you can rewrite it;
2. The default style of `FramelessWindow` is borderless window with DWM shadow. If you want other special effects, such as acrylic effect, you can rewrite the `__init__()` function of `FramelessWindow`. Here is an example:

    ```python
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.monitor_info = None
        self.titleBar = TitleBar(self)
        self.windowEffect = WindowEffect()
        # remove border
        self.setWindowFlags(Qt.FramelessWindowHint | Qt.WindowSystemMenuHint |
                            Qt.WindowMinimizeButtonHint | Qt.WindowMaximizeButtonHint)
        self.setStyleSheet('background:transparent')
        # Add window animation and acrylic blur
        self.windowEffect.addWindowAnimation(self.winId())
        self.windowEffect.setAcrylicEffect(self.winId())
        self.resize(500, 500)
        self.titleBar.raise_()
    ```
3. The window using the acrylic effect may be stuck when dragging. See the blog for solution.
